/*
    for loops can be useful when we already know exactly how many times we want to loop.

    Below we have 2 arrays which have exactly the same number of values.
        - The first array is a list of cities
        - The second array is a list of temperatures
    The cities in the first array correspond with the temperatures in the second array.
    For example, the temperature in London is 10 degrees.

    Using a for loop, output to the console a line about the temperature in each city.

const CITIES = [
    "London",
    "Paris",
    "Barcelona",
    "Dubai",
    "Mumbai",
    "São Paulo",
    "Lagos"
]

const TEMPERATURES = [
    10,
    12,
    17,
    27,
    29,

];

// TODO - Write for loop code here

/*
The output should look something like this:

The temperature in London is 10
The temperature in Paris is 12
The temperature in Barcelona is 17
The temperature in Dubai is 27
The temperature in Mumbai is 29
The temperature in São Paulo is 23
The temperature in Lagos is 33
